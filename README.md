KC to Discord Relayer
=====================

Have you ever played Kancolle, then got depressed that Discord only showed a sad little question mark next to the game, instead of a glorious Kancolle icon? Fear not - introducing: 

# Rich Presence Integration for Kancolle!

What it looks like:

![idle_home](./img/idle.PNG)

## Features

* What map/node you're playing on (if any)
* Whether you're in PVP or not
* HQ level
* Idle/Active indicator
* Kancolle icon (very important!)
* its actually useless tho and hard to use

## Usage/Installation

1. install nodejs and dependencies
2. change chrome to developer mode (chrome://extensions -> developer mode)
3. Load unpacked extension...
4. Navigate to this directory and click `extension_part`
5. Open terminal/cmd.
6. In the directory of main.js, run `npm run start`
7. Hope it works :^)

## Contact

Feel free to add an issue or something if something broke/is bugged. Also i have no idea if this will work if you use someone else's discord app. I don't actually know if all the stuff works. Also feel free to put requests and stuff.
